- A list of existing agents (if any have already been created)
- Agent names, statuses (Active/Inactive), and the primary **Goal** of each agent

## Create Agents ➕

To create a new agent:

1. **Click on “Create agent”** (top right).
2. **Fill in the agent details**:
    - **Agent name**: Give your agent a recognizable name (e.g., “Rico Coolz”).
    - **Agent personality**: Select the AI’s communication style (e.g., friendly, empathetic, analytical).
    - **Agent language**: Choose the main language for the agent’s responses.
    - **Business description in ‘tantrance’**: Provide a brief description of your business so the agent can reference it when interacting with leads.
    - **Your business offer**: Describe what you’d like the AI to pitch or highlight (e.g., product, service, special promotion).
    - **Qualification questions**: List questions your agent should ask leads (e.g., current situation, budget, interest).
    - **Min. / Max. message time range**: Define how quickly the agent responds between each message (in minutes).
    - **Enable followups**: If enabled, the agent will automatically follow up with leads after the initial conversation.
    - **Strategy**: Specify whether the agent should check if the lead agrees to a callback or invite them to book a call directly.
    - **Emoji frequency**: Control how often the agent uses emojis.
    - **Directness**: Determine whether the agent’s tone is more empathetic or more direct.
3. **Preview agent**: Click “Preview agent” to test how the AI will respond based on your settings.
